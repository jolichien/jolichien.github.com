    <div class="invisible" id="rules">
        <p>There are two players. Role the dice to inflict damage on your opponent! The total of the roll is subtracted from the opponent's HP, unless either die comes up as a “one”. If this happens, the attack misses, and it is the other player’s turn. After each roll, the current player can either roll again, (assuming a “one” was not rolled) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The last one standing wins!</p> 
        <p>If you roll two “ones," your opponent's HP is completely restored, so avoid that if you want to win!</p>
