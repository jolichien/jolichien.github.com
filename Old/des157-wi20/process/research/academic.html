    <p>Given that the subject I want to tackle on my final project is the problem of negativity on the internet, I read three articles regarding said subject. The first article I read was “Online Negativity: How to Create a Better Internet for Everyone” by Celestine Chua. As the title suggests, it is an article about creating a better environment on the internet. Chua explains that the internet has become an “angry” place where people snap at each other for the smallest reasons and how civility seems to be rare on the internet nowadays. She recalls some of her own experiences with negativity and points out that people seem to forget that “behind every social media profile is a human being” (Chua). She then goes into a list of ways that people can work towards creating a better internet: recognizing the humanity behind each screen, practicing greater patience, being more understanding, being nice in general, giving encouragement over criticism and actually being helpful with criticism, etc. She concludes her article telling people to remember that “the internet is ultimately powered by people, for people” (Chua). So instead of bashing on things one sees on the internet that one may not like, one should focus on the things that one does like.

    <p>The second article I read was “Why Is Everyone on the Internet So Angry?” by Natalie Wolchover. Wolchover, like Chua, notes the abundance of negativity on the internet and cites psychologists that agree that this “this addictive form of vitriolic back and forth should be avoided — or simply censored by online media outlets — because it actually damages society and mental health” (Wolchover). Therefore the article sets to explain why people engage in this activity when it is clearly not a productive or healthy use of time. Wolchover explains that firstly,  anonymity on the internet acts as a security blanket; secondly, the internet creates a distance from the targeted individual; and thirdly, it is easier to be rude through written text than through speech. Wolchover also explains that “chiming in on comment threads may even give one a feeling of accomplishment, albeit a false one” (Wolchover). She also references Art Markman, psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who notes the importance of in person conversation to fully understand one’s message through tone of voice and gestures that aren’t possibly through text.

    <p>The third article I read was “The Psychology of Online Comments” by Maria Konnikova. Konnikova points out the effects of anonymity effect and cites the “online disinhibition effect,” a term coined by psychologist John Suler, that suggests that “the moment you shed your identity the usual constraints on your behavior go, too” (Konnikova). And while anonymity, on one hand, can encourage participation and a greater sense of community, on the other hand, it promotes incivility. Konnikova notes the contradicting effects of anonymity and a shift in focus on anonymity as a source of negativity to other things such as tone and content and the comments themselves. She cites the “nasty effect” which suggests that the ruder the comments, the more polarized the response is to a piece of content. But Konnikova also notes that non-face-to-face interactions are not new (letters, phone calls, etc.) and regardless of different communication technologies, human interaction is still governed by the same set of rules. Therefore: “The question instead is whether the outliers, the trolls and the flamers, will hold outsized influence—and the answer seems to be that, even protected by the shade of anonymity, a dog will often make himself known with a stray, accidental bark” (Konnikova). Essentially, it seems that Konnikova argues that it is not necessarily the internet itself that stirred up this negativity and rather specific human behavior itself.
