    <h2>Product - Happify</h2>
    <p>Happify is a website (and app) that aims to bring more happiness to the user’s life by introducing various writing activities and games. The app allows the user to track the positivity in their life as well. Overall, the user interface is nice and easy to navigate; the infographic-like intro is informative and tells the user what Happify is about. A questionnaire to create an account pops up upon clicking “Start My Journey” and I like how casual the whole process feels, especially with the way that the questionnaire phrases its questions. For example, when asking for the user’s occupational status, the questionnaire offers, “That job thing.” and lists a series of options rather than asking something more stitled like “What is your occupational status?”. </p>

    <p>In terms of the emotional impact of this project, the interface and the flow of the website makes it feel rather reliable and believable. Additionally, I also like the message that the project sends across. On the about page, Happify explains their goal to be using technology to better the lives of people, which is the direction that I want to go with my final project. </p>
    <p>In comparison to the other project I researched, Grateful, Happify’s interface and purpose feels a little more professional, which on one hand, can feel more reliable, but on the other hand, can feel a little more stiff. Happify also asks for more information right off the bat so it takes more effort for the user to actually get into using the website or app, which as stated earlier, contributes to the reliability of the product, but could also sway people that are less patient from getting into using the product. Overall, Happify seems to be effective in what it is trying to do.

    <h2>Product - Grateful: A Gratitude Journal</h2>
    <p>Grateful: A Gratitude Journal is a phone journaling application that focuses on gratitude and expressing gratitude. The app assists the user by providing daily prompts and methods of reflection to focus on the good things in life. The app’s interface is simple, clean, and easy on the eyes with a solid color palette (customizable colors as well) and cute icons. The app also acts as a starting point for people that are considering getting into journaling but are intimidated by starting from scratch.</p>
    <img src="images/gratitude.jpg" alt="Gratitude: A Gratitude Journal App Interface" title="Apple App Store Screen Capture" width="700 px" height="356 px">
    <p>In terms of the emotional impact of the app, I think the consistent design of the app makes it rather soothing to use. It feels like a nice app to keep around, even if it’s one that has no addictive draw to it (like games and social media). However, it does rely on the user a lot to make use of it so it might feel a bit more like a glorified notebook app than anything particularly impactful or life changing.</p>
    <p>In comparison to Happify, Grateful’s interface is definitely cuter and a little more cohesive. The app is consistent throughout and is pleasing to look at. It also asks for no sign ups or logins so the user can use it immediately upon downloading, which means that the user doesn’t really have to sit through pages of questionnaires to get to the actual content. Those that are concerned about privacy are also put more to ease. The purpose of Gratitude, however, is definitely different than Happify though, as Gratitude seems to attempt to act as more of a method for the user to realize their own happiness while Happify seems to want to be a tool to help the user find more happiness. Overall, while I probably wouldn’t use Grateful (more because I just can’t seem to get into the habit of things like journaling for the life of me), it seems like an effective app for its purposes.</p>
